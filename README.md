# Liri-Node-App

This app is a Siri-like app used to take user input and return information they want about different media.

The technologies used in this app are javascript, node.js, moment.js, dotenv, axios, and node-spotify-package.

Commands
1. "spotify-this-song" and "song title" will return information about a specific song.
2. "concert-this" and "artist name" will return 5 data entries about concert venues and tour dates.
3. "movie-this" and "movie name" will return information about a specific movie.
4. "do-what-it-says" will read a .txt file and return the information from the .txt file.


You will have to supply your own .env with your own Spotify id and secret if you wish to clone this.
